# ProfileStation

## Project Overview

_ProfileStation_ is a small-scale web application designed to demonstrate my backend skillset using Node.js, Express, and various templating engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars (HBS). The application features a simple login form where users can enter their credentials, and upon validation, their profile is displayed.

## Key Features

- User authentication system.
- Profile display post-login.
- Backend emphasizes Node.js and Express.
- Templating with Pug, EJS, and HBS.
- Basic frontend with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
